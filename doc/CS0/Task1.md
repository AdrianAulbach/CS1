#CS0 ‚Äì Task 1
###1. Each team member reads the report
###2. With in your team,discuss your findings concerning the questions above 
###3. Summarize your findings


##a) What were the main reasons the project failed?
#Over designed very rigid, and roles where not distributed correctly. 
* To many external firms where needed to achieve the workload. 
* The external partner changed often. There was no clear unified direction in which the project was directed. 
* There where chronically changes of the milestones, which made efficient planing impossible. 
* Task where implemented more than once due to a lack of of proper management. 
* To many people where where in the GPA even if their position or knowledge didn't contribute to the mater discussed. This is     
     a mismanagement of funds.
* Planned synergies where not used during the Project.
* Lacking know how in the teams and in the management.
* No clear specifications where provided to the external firms, which led to its own dynamic of the external firms.

##b) Why is software complex?
* Many components
* Software doesn't need to be complex but it can evolve over the development cycle into a complex and intricate form which at  
   one point becomes very hard to manage.

##c) Why is software engineering challenging?
* Every body has a different opinion and approach and non of them are strictly seen wrong or less optimal.
* Because software is complex and people are stupid üëç 
* Users are talking a different language to the developers, this can make it hard to find common ground.

##d) What are the implications for software engineering?
* U should test all your stuff well
* With increased complexity u can't develop software by your self, go and get you some indians to write your code for cheap...
* U should know requirements of tha project
* Don't work to hard and get a beer, nobody cares anyways
