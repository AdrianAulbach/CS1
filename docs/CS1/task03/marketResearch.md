Current solutions mainly desktop based, PolyPoint PEP seems to be the only one with a mobile app but it has terrible reviews. (Mobile app only for staff to synchronize shifts with the employees personal calendar, requests for switching shifts can be done in the app as well as wishes for vacation and days off)
-> not much competition for a web-based mobile app.
Current solutions focus on use in a single Institution (eg. Hospital) at once, exchange of data is often done by transferring printed records whose data is later tiped into the software of the other institution
